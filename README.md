# Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130 

## IC Package 

![ard](https://github.com/Shashanksharma280201/PES_OpenLane_PD/assets/79470436/1c46e484-c6c9-4974-9e4b-40561379084a)

The most critical component of the IC is the ```chip``` because it contains the actual functionality of the device and IO pads helps in exchange of signals with the chip.

## CHIP

![riscv](https://github.com/Shashanksharma280201/PES_OpenLane_PD/assets/79470436/4986aa96-829b-4355-b5ff-0da1356477fb)

A chip usually consists of different components such as macros, IO Pads and pins, Foundary IPs etc.

1. **Macros:** Macros in VLSI design are predefined and reusable blocks of digital circuitry, often standard cells, used to simplify the design process by providing building blocks for complex integrated circuits.

2. **Foundry IPs (Intellectual Property):** Foundry IPs are pre-designed and verified circuit components, such as analog blocks, memory cores, or standard interfaces, licensed from semiconductor foundries for integration into custom chip designs.

3. **IO Pads and IO Pins:** IO pads are the physical interfaces between a chip and the external world, while IO pins are the electrical connections from these pads to the internal circuitry, facilitating input and output communication in integrated circuits.

## Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)

To develop an ASIC, We mainly require 3 components
- RTL IPs (github.com, opencores.org, librecores.org)
- PDK data (Qflow, OpenRoad, OpenLane)
- EDA Tools [google+skywater](github.com/google/skywater-pdk)

1. **```RTL```** : It is a level of abstraction in digital design and electronics where a system's behavior is described in terms of registers, logic gates, and the flow of data between them.
2. **```PDK```** : Process Design Kit is a collection of files, libraries, and documentation provided by semiconductor foundries to assist designers in creating integrated circuits (ICs) that are compatible with a specific manufacturing process. PDKs include information on design rules, device models, and technology files required for designing and simulating ICs.
3. **```EDA```** : Electronic Design Automation tools are software tools used for designing and testing electronic systems, including ICs and PCBs.

## RTL2GDSII FLow (simplified)

- ```synthesis```
- ```Floorplanning```
- ```Powerplanning```
- ```Placement```
- ```Clock Tree Synthesis```
- ```Routing```
- ```Signoff```

EDA Tools go through all these steps mentioned to obtain the required Layout file that is required for tapeout and The **GOAL** is to produce a clean GDSII with no human intervention which can be used to harden macros and chips (clean : No LVS, DRC, Timing violatons).

## OpenLane

## OpenLANE Design Stages

OpenLANE flow consists of several stages. By default all flow steps are run in sequence. Each stage may consist of multiple sub-stages. OpenLANE can also be run interactively as shown [here][25].

1. *Synthesis*
    1. `yosys` - Performs RTL synthesis
    2. `abc` - Performs technology mapping
    3. `OpenSTA` - Pefroms static timing analysis on the resulting netlist to generate timing reports
2. *Floorplan and PDN*
    1. `init_fp` - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
    2. `ioplacer` - Places the macro input and output ports
    3. `pdn` - Generates the power distribution network
    4. `tapcell` - Inserts welltap and decap cells in the floorplan
3. *Placement*
    1. `RePLace` - Performs global placement
    2. `Resizer` - Performs optional optimizations on the design
    3. `OpenPhySyn` - Performs timing optimizations on the design
    4. `OpenDP` - Perfroms detailed placement to legalize the globally placed components
4. *CTS*
    1. `TritonCTS` - Synthesizes the clock distribution network (the clock tree)
5. *Routing*
    1. `FastRoute` - Performs global routing to generate a guide file for the detailed router
    2. `CU-GR` - Another option for performing global routing.
    3. `TritonRoute` - Performs detailed routing
    4. `SPEF-Extractor` - Performs SPEF extraction
6. *GDSII Generation*
    1. `Magic` - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def
    2. `Klayout` - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def as a back-up
7. *Checks*
    1. `Magic` - Performs DRC Checks & Antenna Checks
    2. `Klayout` - Performs DRC Checks
    3. `Netgen` - Performs LVS Checks
    4. `CVC` - Performs Circuit Validity Checks

OpenLane can be operated at 2 different modes ie., Automated flow and Interactive mode.

## To enter the automated flow, use these commands
```
cd OpenLane
make mount
./ flow.tcl -design openlane/<DESIGN_NAME>  -tag <TAG>
```

## To enter the Interactive mode, use these commands 
```
cd OpenLane
make mount
./flow.tcl -interactive 
prep -design <path_to_your_design_folder> -tag <tag> -overwrite //overwrite is optional
```

**Interactive mode** offers us to learn all the steps present in automated flow step by step.
The steps are as follows : 

```
run_synthesis
run_floorplan
run_placement
run_cts
run_routing
write_powered_verilog followed by set_netlist $::env(lvs_result_file_tag).powered.v
run_magic
run_magic_spice_export
run_magic_drc
run_lvs
run_antenna_check
```

<summary>DAY 2 : Good Floorplan vs Bad Floorplan and Introduction to library cells</summary>
<br>

## Chip Floorplanning Considerations

### 1. Define Width and height of core and die

- ```Die``` : Structure that consists of core which is a small semiconductor material on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated.
- ```core``` : Structire that contains primary logic and functional components.

Whenever we come across the concepts of core and die, ```Utilisation factor``` plays an important role.
UTILISATION FACTOR = Area Occupied by the Netlist / Area of the core (usually 50%-70%)
ASPECT RATIO = Height / Width (1 = square, others = rectangle)

### 2. Define Location of Pre-Placed cells

```pre-placed cells``` : memories, clock gating cells, comparator, mux etc

- The arrangement of these IPs on chip is called FLOORPLANNING
- These IPs have user defined locations and hence are placed in chip before automated placement and routing. Therefore called pre-placed cells.
- Automated PnR tool places the remaining logical cells in design onto chip.

### 3. De-coupling capacitors

_____Problem_____
We know that all the combinational blocks are connected to Vdd and Vss for their operation. But when there is a large circuit with many resistors, then The capacitors in the logic might not get fully charged as there occurs voltage deop due to wire metal and the resistors present along the path. So after voltage drop, if the voltage obtained by the logic is within noise margin, then it works well but what if it doesn't? 

_____Solution_____
We use De-Coupling capacitors (A huge capacitance with voltage equal to that of supply voltage) that is placed close to the combinational logic. When the switching activity takes place, it detatches the circuit from main supply and this capacitor acts as power supply.

The local communication has been successfully eshtablished with the solution mentioned above. The global communication is taken care by power planning.

### 4. Power Planning

- Power planning during the Floorplanning phase is essential to lower noise in digital circuits attributed to voltage droop and ground bounce. Coupling capacitance is formed between interconnect wires and the substrate which needs to be charged or discharged to represent either logic 1 or logic 0.
- When a transition occurs on a net, charge associated with coupling capacitors may be dumped to ground. If there are not enough ground taps charge will accumulate at the tap and the ground line will act like a large resistor, raising the ground voltage and lowering our noise margin. To bypass this problem a robust PDN with many power strap taps are needed to lower the resistance associated with the PDN.

### 5. Pin Placement

- ```Pin placement``` is an essential part of floorplanning to minimize buffering and improve power consumption and timing delays.
- We usually place input pins on the left and output pins on the right
- for primary inputs and outputs, pin size may be small and for clock, the pin size would be large because clock should drive many cells so we need to make sure that the resistance is less.
- larger the area, lesser the resistance.
- ```Placement blockage``` is done inorder to makesure that no logic is placed along the area where the pin placement is carried out.

## Floorplan

```run_floorplan```

Before running floorplan, lets look into the switches available for the floorplan stage

![day2 1](https://github.com/Shashanksharma280201/PES_OpenLane_PD/assets/79470436/ad099daf-509b-45f5-aa49-68085f8aa8f4)

Changes made in the config.tcl for floorplan purpose:

![day2 2](https://github.com/Shashanksharma280201/PES_OpenLane_PD/assets/79470436/b3c11bc8-46c7-42cc-86d6-84c4a5525d30)

Now in openlane, enter ```run_floorplan``` and the results will be updated at the runs folder

![day22](https://github.com/Shashanksharma280201/PES_OpenLane_PD/assets/79470436/bb3e8af1-baea-49f7-8e07-556d41a21dad)

(0 0) in DIE AREA Indicates top-left corner co-ordinates and (660.685 671.405) indicates bottom-right corner of the die in micro-meters

To view the layout of the floorplan, use the command ```magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &```

- ```-T indicates``` techfile
- ```&``` is used to avoid the prompt that magic shows

![day2 3](https://github.com/Shashanksharma280201/PES_OpenLane_PD/assets/79470436/167d29ea-0b29-4149-a00f-a07f0eb44dc7)

## Library Binding and Placement

### 1. Bind the netlist with physical cells

- ```Library``` consists of cells, sizes of cells, various flavours and shapes of the cells, Timing, Power and delay information.
- Now, we have the floorplan, netlist and representation of components of netlist in library
- place all the components such that the timing is not disturbed and distribute them properly. 


### 2. Optimize Placement

- Some components may be located very far to their inputs which can disturb signal integrity (as wire length increases, RC value increases). Therefore we use repeaters(may be series of buffers) inorder to avoid signal loss but area loss comes into picture.
- Assuming that all the clock signals are working at ideal rate, we do the timing analysis if the current placement works good.

### 3. Placement

```run_placement```

![day2 4](https://github.com/Shashanksharma280201/PES_OpenLane_PD/assets/79470436/545ead72-6939-4762-ae1a-8992b7df5099)

## Cell Design Flow

Cell design is done in 3 parts:

1. **Inputs** - PDKs (Process design kits), DRC & LVS rules, SPICE models, library & user-defined specs.
2. **Design Steps** - Design steps of cell design involves Circuit Design, Layout Design, Characterization. The software GUNA used for characterization. The characterization can be classified as Timing characterization, Power characterization and Noise characterization.
3. **Outputs** - Outputs of the Design are CDL (Circuit Description Language), GDSII, LEF, extracted Spice netlist (.cir), timing, noise, power.libs, function.

### Standard cell Charachterization Flow

Standard Cell Libraries consist of cells with different functionality/drive strengths. These cells need to be characterized by liberty files to be used by synthesis tools to determine optimal circuit arrangement. The open-source software GUNA is used for characterization.
Characterization is a well-defined flow consisting of the following steps:

- Link Model File of CMOS containing property definitions
- Specify process corner(s) for the cell to be characterized
- Specify cell delay and slew thresholds percentages
- Specify timing and power tables
- Read the parasitic extracted netlist
- Apply input or stimulus
- Provide necessary simulation commands

### General Timing characterization parameters

#### Timing threshold definitions

- ```slew_low_rise_thr``` - 20% from bottom power supply when the signal is rising
- ```slew_high_rise_thr``` - 20% from top power supply when the signal is rising
- ```slew_low_fall_thr``` - 20% from bottom power supply when the signal is falling
- ```slew_high_fall_thr``` - 20% from top power supply when the signal is falling
- ```in_rise_thr``` - 50% point on the rising edge of input
- ```in_fall_thr``` - 50% point on the falling edge of input
- ```out_rise_thr``` - 50% point on the rising edge of ouput
- ```out_fall_thr``` - 50% point on the falling edge of ouput

These are the main parameters that we use to calculate factors such as propogation delay and transition time

- ```propogation delay ``` - time(out_*_thr) - time(in_*_thr)
- ```Transition time``` - time(slew_high_rise_thr) - time(slew_low_rise_thr)
